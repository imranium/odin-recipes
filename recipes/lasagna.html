    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna, lasagna. How I love thee! It is possibly one of the most loved foods in the whole wide world, and understandably so. There is just something so sentimental about lasagna, so comforting. It evokes images of of gatherings with family and friends all around the world. It is the sort of food that is like a big warm hug, and so more-ish you want to keep digging in until you burst.
    Lasagna just rocks. Full stop.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <div >
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Preboiled lasagna noodles have a lovely texture, but no-boil or oven-ready noodles also work in this recipe. They will absorb extra moisture, so the dish may not turn out quite as saucy.</li>
        <li><strong>Sausage and ground beef:</strong> This combination creates the iconic flavor that defines traditional lasagna. But you could go with all beef or all sausage, or ground chicken or ground turkey. (Vegetable lasagna is also delightful as a meatless variation.)</li>
        <li><strong>Crushed tomatoes and tomato paste:</strong> Tomatoes combine with onions, garlic and meat for a stellar tomato sauce. If you’re running short on time, store-bought pasta sauce also works.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> This secret ingredient transforms an ordinary tomato sauce into one that tastes like it has simmered all day. The sweetness balances the tomato’s acidity, making the sauce more well-rounded.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan cheeses come together to give this lasagna its extra-decadent flavor. For a makeover lasagna, you can reduce the cheese by skipping the mozzarella inside the layers and just sprinkling it on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> The egg acts as a binder, turning the ricotta into a cohesive mixture that sets as the lasagna cooks. This prevents it from turning out watery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructiom</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Or Soak Lasagna Noodles</strong>
            <p>Before assembling lasagna, you have to make lasagna noodles soft.  You can do it by either boiling lasagna noodles according to directions printed on their package, or you can soak them in hot water.  I prefer the soaking method since it’s much easier.  Just put the lasagna noodles in the baking dish, and fill with hot tap water.  In 15 minutes, lasagna noodles will be soft without boiling.</p>
