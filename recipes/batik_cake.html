    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The beauty of kek batik is its fudgy texture that requires no baking! You don't need an oven. Just a packet of Marie biscuits and a generous amount of chocolate sauce and voila!</p>
    <p>It is comparable to the Hedgehog Slice - popular in Australia, as well as the English Chocolate Biscuit Cake, - one of Prince William's wedding cakes. The crumbled biscuits give the cake a design reminiscent of the traditional Malaysian motif; batik, hence the name Kek Batik. Not to be mistaken with Sarawak's batik cake, which comes in a variety of colours. Chocolate fudge and tea biscuits, such as Marie Biscuits or Petit Beurre (French butter biscuit), are used in the preparation of this batik cake.</p>

        <li><em>⅔ cup butter</em></li>

    <h3>Instructiom</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Crush the biscuits into small pieces and set them aside.</em></li>
        <li><em>Prepare a cake pan (any shape of your choosing) and grease well with cooking spray or butter.</em></li>
        <li><em>Gently melt butter on medium heat in a pot.</em></li>
        <li><em>Mix in condensed milk and chocolate/Milo powder and stir it well.</em></li>
        <li><em>Add in eggs and stir continuously on medium to medium-high heat till it thickens.</em></li>
        <li><em>Once it has thickened, add in vanilla extract and stir to mix it all well.</em></li>
        <li><em>Put the crushed biscuits into the pan or pot and stir gently. Pour into the cake pan and flatten the top.</em></li>
        <li><em>Spread a layer of fudge onto the cake pan and stack it with the biscuits if you don't want the biscuits to be crushed. Repeat until you've used up all of your fudge.</em></li>
        <li><em>Leave the cake to cool for an hour then cover and refrigerate overnight.</em></li>
        <li><em>and so on...</em></li>
