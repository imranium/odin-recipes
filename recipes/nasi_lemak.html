    <h3>What's in there???</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coconut Rice:</strong> Rice cooked with coconut milk, water, and pandan leaves, resulting in the sweet aroma of the nasi (rice).</li>
        <li><strong>Sambal:</strong> Spice paste made from dried red chilies, shallots, garlic, and belacan (Malaysian prawn paste). Sambal is usually stir-fried with oil, along with onions and tamarind juice added for tanginess. Salt and sugar are used to balance the flavors.</li>

        <li><strong>Peanuts:</strong> Roasted peanuts, providing a nutty flavor and crunchy texture to the overall dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Cucumber:</strong> Sliced cucumber for a refreshing contrast to the spiciness of the sambal.</li>
        <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Small fish such as mackerel or sardines are fried and served as an accompaniment to nasi lemak.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard-boiled eggs:</strong> Pretty self-explainatory</li>
        <li><strong>Pandan leaves or screwpine leaves:</strong> The leaves are highly fragrant with floral smell. They are used in many Malaysian recipes. Another ingredient is coconut milk, which is used to make the coconut rice.</li>
